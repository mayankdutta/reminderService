Please note that this documentation assumes the use of a RESTful API convention for exposing services, even though the provided code is for a service rather than a route.
If you integrate this service with an API route, you can follow the conventions mentioned above.
Also, make sure to replace placeholders like `"string"` with actual values when making requests.
